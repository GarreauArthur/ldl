Goal : work at least an hour a day on AI/ML/DL/Coding/Project.
My goals in AI are :

* learn more models (RNN, GAN, RL, Trees)
* gain more practical experience
* win at least one kaggle competition

# days -2: 2019-01-01

* Watch last videos of deeplearning.ai course 2

# day -1: 2019-01-02

* Getting use to kaggle and learning tensorflow
* Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

# day 1: 2019-01-03

* Pledging
* starting this log
* Python Data Science Handbook pages 47 to 58
* bash script (nl.sh) to easily add new entries to this log

# day 2: 2019-01-04

* fix small bug of bash script
* Python Data Science Handbook pages 59 to 62 (lol, i feel sick)

Because Random forest seems to be commonly used in kaggle competition, and

* i've waste a little bit of time, trying to calculate some probability for a game
* red : https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests
* done the kaggle exercice on random forests, but it was not very helpful. I
need to implement one from scratch. Scikit-learn is cool and all but, I want to
do it the hard way
* red my notes on decision trees
