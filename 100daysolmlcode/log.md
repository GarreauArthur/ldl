Goal : work at least an hour a day on AI/ML/DL/Coding/Project.
My goals in AI are :

* learn more models (RNN, GAN, RL, Trees)
* gain more practical experience
* win at least one kaggle competition

# days -2: 2019-01-01

* Watch last videos of deeplearning.ai course 2

# day -1: 2019-01-02

* Getting use to kaggle and learning tensorflow
* Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
* <https://www.kaggle.com/cqncpdp/one-sinking-boy>

# day 1: 2019-01-03

* Pledging
* starting this log
* Python Data Science Handbook pages 47 to 58
* bash script (nl.sh) to easily add new entries to this log

# day 2: 2019-01-04

* fix small bug of bash script
* Python Data Science Handbook pages 59 to 62 (lol, i feel sick)

Because Random forest seems to be commonly used in kaggle competition, and

* Learning about and Taking notes on Decision trees :

* Learning about Random forest :
  * end of part 1 <https://youtu.be/J4Wdy0Wc_xQ>
  * part 2 <https://youtu.be/nyxTdL_4Q-Q>

# day 4: 2019-01-06

* i've waste a little bit of time, trying to calculate some probability for a game
* red : https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests
* done the kaggle exercice on random forests, but it was not very helpful. I
need to implement one from scratch. Scikit-learn is cool and all but, I want to
do it the hard way
* red my notes on decision trees

# day 5: 2019-01-07

* Today, I am tired and angry, but Basically I Do Work
* Watching again :
	* deeplearning.ai C5W1L01 : why sequence models
	* deeplearning.ai C5W1L02 : notation
	* deeplearning.ai C5W1L03 : RNN Model
* deeplearning.ai C5W1L04 : Backpropagation through time

# day 6: 2019-01-08

* not very productive today
* deeplearning.ai C5W1L05 : Different types of RNNs
* Start of C5W1L06


# day 7: 2019-01-09

* C4W1L06 : Language model and sequence generation
* C5W1L07 : Sampling novel sequences
* C5W1L08 : Vanishing gradients with RNNs
* StatQuest videos
	* Bias and Variance
	* The confusion matrix
* start implementing decision trees

# day 8: 2019-01-10

* Continue to work on decision trees, it's more difficult than I expected because
I want to deal with numerics, multiple choices, ranks, and binary data. I need
to think a little bit more, before writing code
* C5W1L09 : Gated Recurrent Unit (first 11 minutes)
